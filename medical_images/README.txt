Sample Synthetic Dataset
==================================================

This directory contains 20 synthetic medical-like images
for testing the Adaptive Integrated Grad-CAM pipeline.

Image Complexity Levels:
- LOW: Simple shapes, clear boundaries (~30% of images)
- MEDIUM: Multiple regions, some texture (~40% of images)
- HIGH: Complex patterns, high detail (~30% of images)
